# RuleBasedStoryGeneration
One simple and seemingly effective way to generate a story that absolutely works (at least to some extent) is to use “rules” to select elements from groups or lists and assemble the parts into a story.

The idea is pretty simple actually, if you select or write good rules then the result is they would generate unique (enough) sentences that when combined are a story.

For example, lets say I create a generative “rule” like this:

Rule: proximity location, event.
Seems simple enough but this rule can actually generate quite a few mildly interesting sentences, like this one for example:

in a railroad station, aliens attacked.
Result: (proximity: in) (location: a railroad station), (event: aliens attacked).

Not bad huh? [Keep Reading at my Blog](https://geekgirljoy.wordpress.com/2018/09/13/rule-based-story-generation/)
